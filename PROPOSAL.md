# PROJECT PROPOSAL
# ReserveME

### Description & Motivation:
We are building a program that will take care of most of your travel plans. ReserveME will book your hotel reservation to wherever you desire. This program is meant to be beneficial to both customers and businesses to manage reservations on both ends. We thought of building this program to keep hotel reservations on one platform with all its necessary information.

### Prior Art:
We came up with this idea from similar apps and programs that exist like `Hotels.com`, `Tripadvisor.com`, and many more. Similarly our program allows the user to reserve a hotel room with the addition of tracking their expenses in the hotel as well as meeting the users needs.


### Core User Workflows:
ReserveME will allow you to view which rooms are available at what cost. It will show you all the amenitites and room details when viewing your options. There will be a method of pay system where you will pick how you would like to pay and it will store your bill and payment information. The program will allow you to tell when you would like to check-in at what time and date. There will be mandatory checkout times that will be provided beforehand. 

### Daily Goals:
Tuesday - 

Wednesday - Method of Payment (Show bill), reservation dates, check-in/ check-out times

Thursday - Add any extra features, make a greeting/ make it pretty

### How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit:
With this project, we will be covering the content of databases and classes. For our user/ customer information, it will be represented and stored in a database. For our hotel rooms, the availability and rooms itself will be shown through classes of different types of rooms. For our methods of payment, we will be using class for the different methods of payment. All the information in this program will be stored in a database.
