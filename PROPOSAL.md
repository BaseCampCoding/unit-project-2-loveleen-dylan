# PROJECT PROPOSAL
# 

### Description & Motivation:
We are building a program that will take care of most of your travel plans. It covers for booking your flight and hotel reservations. This program is meant to be beneficial to both customers and businesses to manage reservations on both ends. We thought of building this program to keep any type of travel reservations on one platform rather than having to keep up with multiple apps. 

### Prior Art:
We came up with this idea from similar apps and programs that exist like `Hotels.com`, `Tripadvisor.com`, and many more. Similarly our program allows the user to reserve a hotel room with the addition of tracking their expenses in the hotel as well as meeting the users needs.
