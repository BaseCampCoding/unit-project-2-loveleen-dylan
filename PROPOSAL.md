We are building a program that will take care of most of your travel plans. ReserveME will book your hotel reservation to wherever you desire. This program is meant to be beneficial to both customers and businesses to manage reservations on both ends. We thought of building this program to keep hotel reservations on one platform with all its necessary information.

### Core User Workflows:
ReserveME will allow you to view which rooms are available at what cost. It will show you all the amenitites and room details when viewing your options. There will be a method of pay system where you will pick how you would like to pay and it will store your bill and payment information. The program will allow you to tell when you would like to check-in at what time and date. There will be mandatory checkout times that will be provided beforehand.
