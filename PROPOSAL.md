# PROJECT PROPOSAL
# ReserveME

### Description & Motivation:
We are building a program that will take care of most of your travel plans. ReserveME will book your hotel reservation to wherever you desire. This program is meant to be beneficial to both customers and businesses to manage reservations on both ends. We thought of building this program to keep hotel reservations on one platform with all its necessary information.

### Prior Art:
We came up with this idea from similar apps and programs that exist like `Hotels.com`, `Tripadvisor.com`, and many more. Similarly our program allows the user to reserve a hotel room with the addition of tracking their expenses in the hotel as well as meeting the users needs.


### Core User Workflows:
- The user to view which rooms are available at what cost
- The user can also see the amenitites and room details when viewing options.
- There will be a method of pay system where the user will pick how they would like to pay. 
- It will store the user's bill and payment information for the admin to view. 
- The program will allow the user to tell when you would like to check-in at what time and date. There will be mandatory checkout times that will be provided beforehand. 

### Daily Goals:
Tuesday - Dylan will setup the database to retrieve the user information such as (name, address, zipcode, state, phone number,email). Loveleen will setup a database for creating the hotel rooms and the availability of the rooms (availability, room_type, price, size, guest name). Loveleen will do the greeting/ walk-through display for the user to be able to reserve a room. Dylan will setup the functioning of showing which rooms are abailable. 

Wednesday - Loveleen will set up the method of Payment (Show bill). Dylan will work on reservation dates and displaying mandatory check-in/ check-out times. 

Thursday - Loveleen and Dylan will be adding any extra features they might think of (this will be updated along the way). They will also work on making it look professional. 

### How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit:
With this project, we will be covering the content of databases and classes. For our user/ customer information, it will be represented and stored in a database. For our hotel rooms, the availability and rooms itself will be shown through classes of different types of rooms. For our methods of payment, we will be using class for the different methods of payment. All the information in this program will be stored in a database.
